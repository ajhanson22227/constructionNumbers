# Construction Numbers

This app is a special calculator I made to be used at my office.
It takes a cubic area from length x width x depth of desired roadway and outputs the estimated quantities required for the reconstruction.

## Motivation

Requests for gravel-to-pavement alley/road estimates are common in our work and it's writing the same formulas every time with the only variance being the size. It becomes too time consuming to do every request especially when most of them won't go through with construction. This app takes the area and gives the estimates right away. 

## Built with

This app is written in the Dart language using Google's Flutter library
